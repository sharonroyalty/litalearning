## Overview
---
This Library Management System is a SQL-based project designed to manage the operations of a library. It supports the borrowing and returning of books, managing users, and tracking the availability of books.

## Features
---
- Add new books and users
- Borrow and return books
- Search for books by author, title, or genre
- Track user borrowing history

## Technology Stack
---
- **Backend**: SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying of data

## Data Cleaning
---
This involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Remove Duplicates
- Handle Missing Data
- Standardize Data
- Validate Data
        
## Data Preparation
---
This involves transforming and structuring the data so itâ€™s ready for querying and analysis.
- Normalization
- Data Enrichment
- Transform Data Types
- Create Indexes
- Handling Outliers
- Partitioning Data

## Explanatory Data Analysis
---
Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding the patterns, trends, and relationships in your dataset. For your Library Management System project, EDA can help you uncover insights into how the library operates, book availability, borrowing trends, user preferences, and much more. 
- Understanding the Dataset
Begin by familiarizing yourself the structure of the data and its attributes. For example, the key tables in a Library Management System might include:
   Books Table: Book ID, title, author, genre, publication year, availability status, etc.
    Users Table: User ID, name, membership type, contact details, etc.
    Borrowing History Table: User ID, book ID, borrow date, return date, etc.

## Data Anaylsis
---
Data analysis for your Library Management System project involves diving deeper into the cleaned and prepared dataset to extract actionable insights and validate your hypotheses. In this stage, you aim to understand relationships, patterns, and trends within the data to make informed decisions

```SQL
INSERT INTO Members (MEMBERID,NAME,ADDRESS,PHONENUMBER,EMAIL)
VALUES (6,'Joy Felix', ' 245 Oak St.john', 555-2678, 'joyfelix@gail.com');
select * FROM Members
```
