## Overview
---
This Library Management System is a SQL-based project designed to manage the operations of a library. It supports the borrowing and returning of books, managing users, and tracking the availability of books. It aims at optimize the system’s performance through data-driven insights, helping the library function more effectively and meet users' needs. leveraging on the data to improve the system’s efficiency, user experience, and resource management.

## Objective
 The Objective behind a Library Management System project is to modernize and streamline library operations, enhance user satisfaction, and optimize the management of resources. These improvements not only benefit the library staff but also make the library more efficient and accessible for users.

## Data Source
The data used for this project was synthetically generated to simulate a small library's operations, including book borrowed, returns, and user interactions.

## Insights
These insights show the value of data analysis in helping a library understand its users, optimize resource management, and improve overall operational efficiency. 
- Most Popular Genres
  Insight: The analysis shows that fiction account for 30% of total checkouts, making them the most popular genre among users.
    Actionable Insight: The library can increase its inventory of popular genres to meet user demand.

- Books with High Overdue Rates
 Insight: Non-fiction books, particularly in the reference and academic categories, have the highest overdue rates, with 100% of them being returned after the due date.
    Actionable Insight: Implement stricter return policies or send automated reminders for these categories to reduce overdue books.
## Features
---
- Add new books and users
- Borrow and return books
- Search for books by author, title, or genre
- Track user borrowing history

## Technology Stack
---
- **Backend**: SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying of data

## Data Cleaning
---
This involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Remove Duplicates
- Handle Missing Data
- Standardize Data
- Validate Data
        
## Data Preparation
---
This involves transforming and structuring the data so it’s ready for querying and analysis.
- Normalization
- Data Enrichment
- Transform Data Types
- Create Indexes
- Handling Outliers
- Partitioning Data

## Explanatory Data Analysis
---
Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding the patterns, trends, and relationships in your dataset. For your Library Management System project, EDA can help you uncover insights into how the library operates, book availability, borrowing trends, user preferences, and much more. 
- Understanding the Dataset
Begin by familiarizing yourself the structure of the data and its attributes. For example, the key tables in a Library Management System might include:
   Books Table: Book ID, title, author, genre, publication year, availability status, etc.
    Users Table: User ID, name, membership type, contact details, etc.
    Borrowing History Table: User ID, book ID, borrow date, return date, etc.

## Data Anaylsis
---
Data analysis for your Library Management System project involves diving deeper into the cleaned and prepared dataset to extract actionable insights and validate your hypotheses. In this stage, you aim to understand relationships, patterns, and trends within the data to make informed decisions

```SQL
INSERT INTO Members (MEMBERID,NAME,ADDRESS,PHONENUMBER,EMAIL)
VALUES (6,'Joy Felix', ' 245 Oak St.john', 555-2678, 'joyfelix@gail.com');
select * FROM Members
```
